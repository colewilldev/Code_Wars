Thanks for stopping by! This is my repo where I keep all of my code wars challenges that I have been working on.  I have been finding it pretty addicting lately and wanted a place to document my progress, as I have been averaging about one challenge a day.  Definetly has helped me learn some tricks that I would not have thought of otherwise...  I focus on Javascript and PHP, but you can train just about any OOP language there is.  Really great place to practice programming if you haven't heard of it, definetly go and check it out!

## Maximum Fun! --> Maximum Performance!
