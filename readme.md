Thanks for stopping by! This is my repo where I keep all of my code wars challenges that I have been working on.  I have been finding it pretty addicting lately and wanted a place to document my progress, as I have been averaging about a day.  Definetly has helped me learn some tricks that I would not have thought of otherwise...

## Maximum Fun! --> Maximum Performance!

I actually recorded some live videos that you can watch on youtube too! #overshare?
